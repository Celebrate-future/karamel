To run Karamel, download the Linux/Mac binaries from http://www.karamel.io. You first have to unzip the binaries (``tar -xf karamel-0.2.tgz``).
From your machine's terminal (command-line), run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd karamel-0.2
  ./bin/karamel

This should open a window on your Web Browser if it is already open or open your default Web Browswer if one is not already open. Karamel will appear on the webpage opened.
